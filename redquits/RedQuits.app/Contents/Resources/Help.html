        <h1>RedQuits Help</h1>        
        <p>
        RedQuits is a lightweight application that changes the behavior of the red round button. Now any application quits when you click on the red round button of an application. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        In Mac OS if an app has a window open, you can click the red x on the top (or command-w) and close the window. But that doesnt quit always the application. Some does, others not. AppÂ´s that has no windows open still takes up some ram. If you want to exit the application entirely, then you need to go to the top bar by the apple, click the name of the app, and select "Quit [name of app]" or do command-Q. 
        </p>
        <p>
        RedQuits changes this. All programs now quit and close all open windows if you click the red button.

        <p>
        RedQuits requires that the Accessibility API be enabled. You turn it on by checkin the "Enable access for assistive devices" checkbox in System Preferences > Universal access before using the program.
        </p>        
        <p>
        The program is a lightweight application and runs without a graphical interface. If you would like to stop it and quit the program, double-click its icon, uncheck Activate RedQuits checkbox and close the window.
        </p>
        <p>
        For removing RedQuits entirely, just stop and delete it.
